      <![CDATA[<p>The trick to shipping pots in the mail is to double box them. Wrap the pot in bubble wrap and place in a box slightly larger than the wrapped pot. Fill in the dead spaces with styrofoam peanuts. Then suspend this box in a larger box with a couple inches width of peanuts on all four sides of the box. We ship U.S. Mail as UPS charges a lot more for oversized boxes.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>Obviously, the idea comes first. Our Madison tile came from a series of photos taken by Darlene of downtown Madison from atop the Kentucky bluffs.</p>

<p>Darlene first sketched the the scene on the slab of clay. Slowly clay is added and carved away to provide detail and volume to the tile. At right, Darlene uses a clay tool to pull aside clay from the dome of the Jefferson County Courthouse.</p>

<p>Darlene worked on this tile when it was too hot to do anything else in the summer of 2004. It took two days to finish.</p>

<p>Once the original tile is finished and dried, plaster is poured around the master to create a mold. In turn, once the mold is dry, we press clay into the mold to create the individual tiles.</p>

<p>The tiles are then fired twice, once to 1800F to bake out the impurities in the clay and a second time for the glaze to 2200F.</p>]]>
